/public/

├── blogs.md, fixes1.md (dev files in production)
├── test.html (dev file in production)
/root/
├── PRD.md, GAP_ANALYSIS.md, etc. (8 dev docs at root level)
```

#### **Solution: Professional Organization**
```
/public/
├── blog/ (clean blog section)
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── agricultural-waste-opportunity.html
│   ├── corporate-climate-goals.html
│   ├── tech-giants-biochar.html
│   ├── business-models-guide.html
│   └── southeast-asia-markets.html
/docs/ (development documentation)
├── PRD.md, retro.md, blogs.md, etc.
/dev/ (development files)
├── test.html
```

#### **SEO-Friendly URLs**
- **Before**: `/blog1.html`, `/blog2.html` (poor SEO)

- Updated navigation menus across entire site
- Fixed breadcrumb and footer links
- Verified no broken links remain

## Technical Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Green Padding Issue on Blog Pages
**Problem**: Excessive green padding at top of individual blog pages
**Solution**: Adjusted hero image container height and overlay opacity

**Problem**: External Unsplash image showing as black/not loading
**Solution**: Used local `5th_image.jpg` file provided by user
**Result**: All blog images now load reliably

**Problem**: Moving blog pages to subdirectory broke all internal links
**Solution**: Systematic update of relative paths across all files
**Result**: All navigation working correctly with new structure
