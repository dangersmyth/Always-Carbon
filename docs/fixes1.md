Let's fix a few issues on the site

1. add a linkedin profile for the two founders. use the PRD.md to find the right link
2. the home page has text that is white "No Upfront Costs - We Succeed When You Succeed
We're paid a percentage of ca" in a white box container. make the white box container the same green as the rest of the page
3. Take the services header which creates two options and just create two separate header pages for Biomass Partners and Carbon Credit Buyers
4. About should be renamed About Us.
5. Michael Hallam has co-founder as blue text, should be black text
6. You can't click on About section from Home. Fix this.
