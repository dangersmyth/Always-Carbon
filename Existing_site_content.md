Our goal is to Maximise the tons of CO2 Permanently Removed from the Atmosphere by delivering profitable, sustainable biochar projects
We turn our project partners waste plant biomass into new revenue by turning it into useful biochar.  So if you have waste biomass (any type of plant material), please do get in touch using the contact button below.

In addition to biochar production, Always Carbon works with a wide range of carbon removal and carbon avoidance project partners.  If you have a project that is making a positive difference in the fight against climate change, and building a more sustainable economy, we would love to hear from you and explore how we can help - feel free to use the contact button below.


Our Solution Page

Always Carbon has four primary activities to support our project partners:


Deliver Biochar Production Projects

Issue Carbon Credits

Put Biochar Into Productive Use

Advise Project Partners On Carbon Strategy


Always Carbon has particularly strong capabilities in Strategy, Enviromental Engineering, Carbon Markets, and Engineering allowing us to deliver highly innovative approaches to maximise project's success and impact.  

To discuss your specific project, please use the button at the bottom of the page to contact us.

Biochar production is a proven and scaleable form of engineered permanent carbon removal. 


How it works... 



1. PLANTS ARE HEATED TO HIGH TEMPERATURE IN LOW OXYGEN TURNING THEM INTO CHARCOAL, LOCKING THEIR CARBON SAFELY AWAY AS CHARCOAL


All kinds of plant waste biomass can be used as feedstock.

We work with any equipment manufacturer, and can recommend suppliers of simple, low cost, off the shelf, continuous process pyrolysis ovens.



2. PERMANENT SOLID CARBON


The carbon the plants adsorbed as they grew is locked up as biochar for 100+ years.

Biochar is used for agriculture, soil health, construction, land remediation, water filtration, etc.



3. ALWAYS CARBON PARTNERS


We guide our partners to success making biochar at every step.

We use our expertise to make sure the project is eligible for, and can sell, carbon credits. 

We are paid a percentage of the carbon credits when they are issued, to avoid charging upfront consulting fees and ensure alignment throughout the whole project lifespan.


Biochar Use

In addition to permanently locking away carbon, biochar is a highly useful resource which has many valuable uses. Exampled include:
Activated carbon feedstock (or substitute in some applications)

Water filtration medium

Boosting crop productivity

Livestock feed additive

Remediation of contaminated soil

Air purification

Composting aid

Soil improvement

Decreasing fertiliser runoff

Livestock bedding/litter

Construction materials

TEAM page

The Always Carbon team have delivered numerous projects with strong engineer skills and carbon market expertise.

We partner with biomass owners and operating companies to make biochar on their sites, turning biomass waste cost centres into new sustainable revenues sources by enabling access to carbon markets, and delivering permanent carbon removals.

The Always Carbon core team is fortunate to also work with a global community of advisors, consultants and allies that support our work an enable us to draw on a diverse range of capabilities as and when needed to deliver large scale permanent carbon removals.
